<h1>About Me</h1>

<h3>Discipline,Patience,Preparedness</h3>
<hr />
<p>Hello! I’m a self-proclaimed nerd with a zest for communication—yes, we do exist!
   My journey began with a Bachelor’s in Engineering, where I developed a deep fascination for technology and its workings. 
   However, it wasn’t just the mechanics that intrigued me; I was equally passionate about roles that involved engaging with people on a daily basis. 
   This dual interest steered me towards a fulfilling career in sales and customer service.</p>

<p>I’ve worn many hats over the years: from hunting down leads and clinching sales to diving deep into sales engineering and wrapping my head around customer service. 
  At heart, I’m a product geek and a relentless advocate for my clients, ensuring their voices are heard loud and clear within the company. 
  When it comes to data, I operate on the principle that "while data points the way, it’s insight that paves the road." I'm skilled in crafting compelling technical demonstrations and steering complex system implementations with a dash of flair.</p>

<p>What wakes me up each morning? The thrill of decoding a client's problem and solving it with elegance and efficiency. 
  It's like a daily crossword puzzle, but with higher stakes and happier endings.</p>

  <p>
    Outside the office, you might catch me in the wild—irritating my husband for sport, conquering mountain trails, floating in meditation, or masterminding epic game nights. 
    These moments are my perfect recharge, fueling my zest for life and work with laughter and a touch of mischief.
