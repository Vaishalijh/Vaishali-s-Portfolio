<hr />
<h3>Orphan</h3>
<p> Amazing mystery with unexpected climax. "Donot" google or read reviews before watching</p>
<h3>Gone Girl</h3>
<p>Another very exciting thriller with brilliant acting .Love how the movie unfolds</p>
<h3>A Beautiful Mind</h3>
<p>One of the best movie made out of biographies of a noble price winner Mathematician John Nash. You should just trust my recommendations and not try to google the reviews</p>
